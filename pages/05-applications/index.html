	  <h3>Textizen</h3>			
	  <p>Citizen feedback is essential to the healthy functioning of any democracy, but in-person meetings are personnel-intensive, expensive, and often result in non-representative feedback. Our city partners on the Philadelphia City Planning Commission lamented that many residents couldn’t make it to the few meetings the agency could afford to hold, and that those who did often only represented vocal minorities.</p>
	  <p>In Philadelphia, 41% of residents don’t have access to broadband internet at home, but over 90% have access to mobile phones with text messaging. The CfA Fellows designed, built and successfully piloted Textizen to collect feedback via SMS, allowing an organization to create surveys and collect responses via text message so that traditionally disenfranchised groups can participate. Other cities have taken note, and the fellows are launching a start-up. They've received enthusiastic inquiries from more than 110 cities across the United States, are working with 15 right now, and have already re-deployed in Boston and Salt Lake City.</p>

	  <h3>Honolulu Answers</h3>			
	  <p>Early on a Saturday in July, more than 55 Honolulu community members came together to write content for the city’s new website – Honolulu Answers. Though the existing Honolulu.gov website has a wealth of great information, citizens found it difficult to navigate and challenging to find the specific information they were looking for. In live user testing with residents, CfA fellows found that people visiting Honolulu.gov weren’t there to browse; they were in search of an answer to a specific question.</p>
	  <p>From the ground up, Honolulu Answers was designed to be people-centric. Our team designed “Quick Answers” pages that addressed just one question, starting with the most frequent questions based on city Customer Service Department data and website analytics. Citizens who need more can branch off into more detailed “Guides.” Honolulu Answers is not only driven by citizen questions, it’s also driven by citizen- focused writing. Code for America and the City of Honolulu hosted a “civic write-a-thon” to write approachable, easy-to-understand answers.</p>

	  <h3>BlightStatus</h3>			
	  <p>In New Orleans, countless organizations are working around the clock to improve local communities and reduce blight throughout the city. However, each group manages data about blighted properties individually, which results in duplicated efforts and inconsistent information.</p>
	  <p>Partnering with the city and the Redevelopment Authority, the fellows created BlightStatus to make it simple for residents to find out what’s going on with blighted properties in their community – no long waits on the telephone or visits to City Hall required.</p>
	  <p>BlightStatus pulls property information directly from the city, providing a single, comprehensive and authoritative view. The public can check out a property’s status bar, then scroll down to the detailed case history for a step-by-step description of what’s happened so far. Citizens can also subscribe to receive instant alerts the moment the status changes on properties that they care about.</p>

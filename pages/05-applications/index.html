	  <h3>Textizen</h3>			
	  <p>Citizen input is essential to the healthy functioning of any democracy, but the Philadelphia City Planning Commission lamented that many residents couldn’t make it to the few in-person meetings the agency could afford to hold, and that those who did often represented only vocal minorities.</p>
	  <p>In Philadelphia, 41% of residents don’t have access to broadband Internet at home, but over 90% have access to mobile phones with text messaging. The CfA Fellows designed, built and deployed Textizen, which uses posters and bus shelter ads to solicit hyper-local feedback via SMS, allowing an organization to create targeted surveys and collect responses via text message so that traditionally disenfranchised groups can participate. Other cities have taken note, and now the Fellows are starting a company to meet the demand. They've heard from more than 110 cities around the country, and are now working with 15, including Boston and Salt Lake City.</p>

	  <h3>Honolulu Answers</h3>			
	  <p>CfA’s Honolulu team faced a near-impossible challenge. Nearly everyone they interviewed, inside City Hall as well as outside, wanted a better website. But with tens of thousands of pages of content owned by dozens of departments, the project was out of scope for a team of three in under a year.</p>
	  <p>Undeterred, the Fellows mined the search logs of Honolulu.gov to find what the public was looking for when they came to the site, and tried those top searches in live user testing with residents. Though the existing website has a wealth of information, it consistently failed to meet citizens’ needs: to answer their basic questions about how to interact with government.</p>
	  <p>So the team wrote clear, plain language answers to the most frequently asked questions, based on data from the search logs and from the customer service department. They put these in a simple, beautiful, easy-to-use interface they called Honolulu Answers. But they still had to find a way for the site to grow, and to live on past their tenure. So they tapped the power of the community.</p>
		<p>Early on a Saturday in July, more than 55 Honolulu residents came together to write simple, plain-language answers to dozens more of their top questions. At what may be the first ever civic “write-a-thon,” this group not only created an invaluable tool to make it easier for every Honoulan to do things like get a drivers license, they also created a community that continues to take responsibility for their own access to government information, a community that maintains Honolulu Answers even today.</p>

	  <h3>BlightStatus</h3>			
	  <p>In New Orleans, countless organizations are working to reduce blight and improve neighborhoods throughout the city. However, each group managed data about blighted properties individually, and the city’s systems kept data about reports, notifications, inspections, hearings and judgments all in separate silos. Even in City Hall there was no way to see the status of a blighted property without having all the actors in the same room at monthly meetings, which were dominated by tensions between residents and City Hall. City officials estimated that fixing the problem would take about three years, and require expensive upgrades to several municipal IT systems.</p>
	  <p>CfA’s New Orleans Fellows found all the relevant data, unified it, and made it accessible through a simple web and mobile interface called BlightStatus. For the first time, anyone can type in an address in New Orleans and immediately see whether the property has been reported or inspected for blight, whether the owners have been notified, if there’s a hearing scheduled or a judgement that’s pending on the property. Citizens can also subscribe to receive instant alerts the moment the status changes on properties that they care about. The tool took months to build, not years, and offers proof to municipal IT staff everywhere that there is a better way.</p>
	  <p>Most importantly, citizens, neighborhood groups, and City Hall are no longer fighting about the data. Instead, they’re working together to solve the problems. As one staffer told the fellows when they introduced the tool at the municipal blight meeting, “you changed the conversation.”</p>
